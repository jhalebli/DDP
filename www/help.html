<body>
The WorldGDP-PPP applications takes world population and GDP data and breaks the data into deciles based
on population.  It uses the rworldmap package to display that data as a bubble-based heat map onto a
mercator map projection of the world.  The data can be filterd by deciles by choosing a minimum decile range
and a maximum decile range.  If the lower decile range is set to 1, for example, it will start with the
lowest 10% of the countries in the list by population and if the maximum is set to 8, it will include all
the countries above the minimum set up to but not including the top 20% of countries by population. <p>

The HDI (Human Development Index) is an index created by the United Nations Development Programme which represents
a composite calculated index based on relative life expectancy, mean years of schooling, and gross national
income per capita, as expressed in PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) dollars.  For countries whose data is available,
HDI current does not drop below 0.4, where 1.0 is the relative maximum index that a country may be assigned.  The application allows the user to filter according to a minimum and maximum HDI index and eliminate countries outside
the lower or upper bounds. <p>

The size of the bubble located in the centroid of each country represents the relative population size of each
country in comparison with the list being summarized, while the color represents the relative GDP per capita expressed
in PPP.  The application also counts the number of countries who meet the criteria set by the decile and HDI
sliders.  Not all countries in the data are displayed as some countries do not have a supplied GDP per capita (PPP) available in the data (set to 'n/a'). <p>
